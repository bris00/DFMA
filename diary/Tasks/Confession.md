# Confession

From: [[2023-01-07]]

Honesty is important in any relationship, and communication is key. This task allows Miss Ana to get to know me a bit better and will hopefully give me opportunity and motivation to confess my feelings to Miss Ana. The task is to write about 300 words, the topic must be one of the following:

1. Confess a fantasy where I imagined Miss Ana.
2. Confess a time in public where I got hard, what happened and what was I thinking.
3. Tell Miss Ana about something I feel embarrassed about, been reluctant or afraid to share, or something I've told very few other people.
