Spend 30 minutes working on a project that aims to make something useful for you. 

A project idea could be a mod for a game you'd like to use on your simps/lockees. Another could be to make it easier to use my digital lockbox for keyholders. It's very good hardware wise, but the controlling software is not made with chastity play in mind...
