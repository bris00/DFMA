There are multiple escape rooms nearby, but none without 15Â min walk ðŸ˜‘ 

Tour Italica
A 14-minute walk from your hotel, a tour starts of an old Roman amphitheatre, the place looks amazing and would be the first place I would visit if I had some free time in Seville.

suvenirs Hermanas
A 5-minute walk from your hotel, a souvenir shop with some oddities to take home with you.

Flamenco Dance Museum (requires ticket)
A 8-minute walk from your hotel, a museum related to the flamenco art style, has interactive exhibitions about the history, choreography, styles of flamenco dance throughout the last two decades. Flamenco paintings, drawings, and sculptures. And a selection of Roman and pre-Roman stones in the basement, used for events and the like.

CasaLa Teatro
A theatre 11 minutes away where you can see, amongst other things, flamenco shows.

Food

Alfalfa 
About 11 minutes away from your hotel is the neighbourhood that is the historical centre of the town. Here you can find traditional tapas and wine, or cocktails and beer. Nice vibe on a Friday or Saturday night.

Alameda de Hercules
A garden square about 15 minutes away from your hotel, has bars where locals like to go (cheap beer). Las Columnas is supposed to be good, if you're there the Montadito de PringÃ¡ sandwich was recommended

El rinconcillo
14 minutes away. Claims to be the oldest bar in Seville, apparently has excellent food. But can be packed.

Restaurante El Pasaje Tapas
A 9-minute walk from your hotel, seems like a restaurant with high quality food where you can get tapas and paella. Which in my book is a must when in Spain.

Blanco Cerrillo
Good and cheap fried fish, only 5 minutes away
