Just as Lemillion has reached his limit, Deku, Nighteye and Eraser Head comes crashing through the wall to help. It was looking good for a while, but Eraser Head got taken out quickly, and a bit of Nighteyes blood got spilled, and it was enough for his quirk to somehow get removed. Was it Eri who did that? In either case, when Nighteye's quirk stops working he quickly gets pierced by Overhauls rocks and is and in a very bad way. He's if not dead, severely wounded and needs immediate medical help. This leaves Deku to fight against Overhaul alone, while he leaves evacuating Eri to Lemillion who is in a bad way himself. Eventually, Overhaul uses some psychic powers to get the now alone Eri to return, and this puts Deku in an impossible situation. Deku does not give up though, even though Nighteye uses his last breath to tell Deku that he saw Overhaul killing Deku and getting away with Eri if he did not run away.
