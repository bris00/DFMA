The hero class wakes up to realize on their way home they've become famous overnight. Izuku is hassled a bit on public transport. Later, they all have to choose hero names for their future and chose a place to intern as a hero. As it would be useful to get some real life hero experience for the 1.st year students. Midnight is sexualized as usual. ðŸ˜… Izuku choses the name Deku to the delight of Uraraka. Izuku also gets a offer to intern at All Might's old teacher, and All Might is very conflicted about this. But he encourages Deku to do so. Lida's hospitalized brother wanted him to take his name, but Lida instead choses his real name, Tenya. And Lida then choses an internship in Tokyo, to the suprise of many who thinks he could have done better. Not to mention, he will have to be away from them all. The last we see is Lida taking a flight away, saying goodbye to Deku and Uraraka.
