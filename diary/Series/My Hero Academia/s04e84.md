The class is holding a dress rehearsal before the big day, Deku finds out later that night that the rope he is using to carry Aoyama is starting to fray. So Deku decides to go to the hardware store first thing in the morning. It just so happens that this hardware store is right next to the place where Gentle is drinking his morning tea at before he's going to break into the festival. Deku and Gentle of course meets, and Deku figures out who Gentle is because he has seen some of Gentle's videos online. Deku then fights Gentle in order to stop him from breaking in. And in the process gets to use his new item that he got from Hatsune. This item enables Deku to concentrate his wind gusts into a small area so that they work more like projectiles than wind. The episode ends as Deku is looking at Gentle bouncing towards UA.
