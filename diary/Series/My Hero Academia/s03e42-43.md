Deku heads off to save the little kid. But the villain finds him first. Deku comes just in time to stop an attack from him and saves the kid. However, the villain is really strong and Deku destroyed his phone, so there will be no help coming. The villain toys with Deku even when Deku hits him at 100% power. Eventually the villain stops playing around and really tries to kill Deku, and it looks bad for a little while. But the little kid uses his quirk even though he hates superpowers and gives Deku a moment to overpower the villain while he's distracted. Deku manages to find some hidden power in the One for All and hits the villain so hard he becomes incapacitated. Deku then brings the kid to Eraser Head and runs off to try to find Baku who the villain seemed to be searching for. My guess is that they want to try to recruit Baku, but we will see.
