The class is having a break from fighting crime to play some baseball together with some other heroes. There is not much to describe from this episode, just some wholesome fun while charging up for the next season. The game ended in a tie as the two last standing players, the team captains, the Gang Orca and the Lion, knocked each other out at the same time.

I also think it was pretty funny how it's apparently okay to knock each other out with quirks… But throwing a baseball bat is a foul because of dangerous play 😆
