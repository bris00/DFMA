I'm not sure if this episode was about Momo's boobs or something else ðŸ˜…

There is not a lot of happening in this episode, a bit of a filler in my opinion. We get to see three groups of students beating their respective teacher opponent, but only barely. I think maybe they are setting up Deku and Baku to be one of the few who loses their fight.
