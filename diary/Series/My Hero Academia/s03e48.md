After All for One teleported Baku and the villains to a street nearby where Deku and his friends were hiding, All Might manages to find them. Deku and his friends totally froze and could not move from the sheer sight of All for One's power. All Might tries to fight and kill All for One, permanently this time. But he has to try to protect Baku at the same time, and this slows him down. Deku manages to come up with a plan to save Baku without breaching any rules, allowing All Might to focus exclusively on All for One. Deku manages to convince Lida and the others of the plan, and they create a projectile out of themselves shooting over the battlefield, and shouts for Baku to jump after and hang on. This works and Baku gets away with the others. 

Without distractions, All Might manages to land a good hit on All for One, but underneath the mask is only a disfigured body. And as the episode ends, we hear All for One taunting All Might.
