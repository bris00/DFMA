Midnight could dominate me whenever she wants ðŸ˜† Not going to lie, I got a bit flushed when watching that scene at the gym. Some more students manage to beat their respective teachers, except 1 par, for a total of 2 pairs that failed in total. Deku and Baku fight each other instead of All Might when it's their turn, however eventually Deku managed to remind Baku that he actually wants to win over All Might at all costs. And they manage to pull off some semblance of teamwork. It ends with Bake distracting All Might and passing out from the fight. And Deku carrying Baku over the finishing line.
