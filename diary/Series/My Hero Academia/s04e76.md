This episode in 5 words: Oh shit, Deku is powerful.

Deku takes on Overhaul and somehow finds his 100% power. Luckily, his synergy with Eri seems excellent, and she is ensuring that his body does not break when he uses that much power. Deku escapes to the surface with Eri. Overhaul follows after him, but Deku surprises him with a hard as fuck punch so that even Nighteye is surprised. This was not part of the future he saw where Deku died and Overhaul got away.
