The first team from class 1-A is fighting 1-B's team. The class A team has got some help from Shinso who is playing for them, making it a 5v4. However, they spend all the time preparing, getting Shinso's quirk explained to them. As they are doing this, suddenly team B attacks with their strongest, a beast quirk, who almost manages to take them on. Team A captures one guy riding the beast's back and almost captures the beast. But in turn two of team A is captured too. They go on to hunt down the remaining 3 and barely wins using a combination of Tsu's great planning and thinking. Denki's electricity as bait. And Shinso's quirk as a means of breaking down the other team's communication.

After all is said and done, both teams get some feedback while the next two teams start preparing for their fight.
