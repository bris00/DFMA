The aftermath of the fight takes place. Deku's blow to overhaul was enough to take him out, and everyone is starting to come to their senses and wanders out to the scene. Eri almost kills Deku with her quirk, since she cannot control it, and she's just radiating a huge amount of energy. Thankfully, Eraser Head comes out and uses his last bit of energy to take away Eri's quirk so that it stops. A deadly silence lays over the scene, as the ambulances start coming in and villains are taken into custody.
