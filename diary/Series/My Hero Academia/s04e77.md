The aftermath of the fight takes place. Deku's blow to overhaul was enough to take him out, and everyone is starting to come to their senses and wanders out to the scene. Eri almost kills Deku with her quirk, since she cannot control it, and she's just radiating a huge amount of energy. Thankfully, Eraser Head comes out and uses his last bit of energy to take away Eri's quirk so that it stops. A deadly silence lays over the scene, as the ambulances start coming in and villains are taken into custody. As Nighteye is carried away, he tells Deku that he and the energy from everyone there managed to change the future. Nighteye later dies in the hospital right after his first talk in a long time with All Might, who finally came to apologize. 

The League of Villains manages to take Overhaul from the police escort who were taking him to the hospital. The league takes his precious anti- bullets. And takes away his quirk, then leaves him by the roadside.
