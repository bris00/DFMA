The fourth match starts and TLDR Baku is dominating. He more or less single-handedly decided the match. However, he did not do so just by brute force like usual. He has apparently learnt to cooperate with others. He also was able to let others help him. This not only levelled up his game, but also surprised the other team. And they got wiped 4-0.

Next up is Deku's team, and now Deku has a lot of pressure to improve even more than Baku did.
