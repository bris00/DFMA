Twice is desperately trying to save Toga, he does this by making a clone of her because he wants to give Toga a blood transfusion. 

Turns out it was not the giant who tore down the tower with the Liberation Army boss. It was Shigaraki who used his quick to destroy the entire tower. They both end up in a one-on-one fight where it seems like the Liberation Army boss has the upper hand with his huge ass body which gives him lots of strength. However, Shigaraki managed to use his quirk and starts destroying the boss' hand. Re-Destro comes back quickly though and deals a hard bowling like strike that knows Shigaraki out so hard he starts remembering his past and how he destroyed his dog, sister, mother, and father. Moulding him into who he is today. 

And now the giant actually shows up for the fightâ€¦.
