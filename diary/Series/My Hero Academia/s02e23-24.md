We saw a very awesome fight between Izuku and Shoto. Izuku used and destroyed his fingers in order to counter most of Shoto's attacks until Shoto started wearing out. Izuku started to get some control over his quirk and managed to get a lot done, he eventually started helping Shoto realize it's okay to use all of his power and things got very emotional with multiple flashbacks to Shoto and his mother. Shoto unleased a lot of power when he used his fire side for real, but Izuku also managed to counter with his quirk. Together they more or less destroyed the entire field with their awesome power, but Izuku was thrown out of bounds while Shoto managed to keep standing. 

After Izuku lost, and while he recovered and got surgery from his injuries, we saw the rest of the fights. And now there is only 4 remaining. Shoto, Bakugo, Lida, and Tokoyami.
