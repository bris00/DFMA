Hawks is spying on the villain's headquarters, and it seems like they have swallowed his spiel hook sink and line. Unless they just put on that performance on his behalf. 

Over at the work study Baku, Deku and Shoto has at Endeavour's is rough but valuable. Endeavour seems pretty insightful and provides each of them with good advice while making them work had on utilizing their quirks to the fullest. Endeavour shows off just how fast he is at handling hero situations, and mostly it's all handled be the time Deku and the others manage to arrive. Even though they are chasing Endeavour at their top speed. Some insight Endeavour shares was about how to really internalize their moves, making them into muscle memory before trying to learn new moves. So that they can multitask without losing concentration on the important things in a fight/situation.
