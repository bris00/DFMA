Deku and Togata are out patrolling on their work study when they stumble upon the criminal gang leader Nighteye has been looking for. Togata wants to leave to not disturb Nighteyes plans, and Deku reluctantly goes along. But the little girl that run out into the streets is clinging to Deku and seems very afraid. Deku finds out her name, Eri, and notices the bandages on her arms, but they eventually lose her when she mysteriously runs robotically to the villain. 

When Nighteye gets there, Deku struggles with not running in immediately and continues to struggle with this and the feeling that Nighteye wanted Togata to become All Mights successor. Deku finds All Might to have a talk about it and learns why Nighteye and All Might don't talk any more.
