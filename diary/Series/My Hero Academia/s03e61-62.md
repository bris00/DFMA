Deku and Baku fights it out at grounds beta. They both put up a good fight, but a robot-guard sees what's going on and alerts Eraser Head. However, Eraser Head is stopped by All Might, who knows Deku better and feels responsible. He arrives just as Baku narrowly managed to get the upper hand and delivers a decisive blow to Deku by using his explosions like rocket-fuel and shoots himself into Deku from the air and Deku hits the ground hard with Baku on top. 

All Might sees this and also overheard them yelling at each other and understands why Baku is so frustrated. All Might helps Baku accept his place, and the relationship between the two seems to improve into a healthy rivalry instead of hatred.

In the next episode, we see the rising levels of villains/crime after All Mights fall. Deku and Baku also has to clean the dorms instead of participating in class. Deku feels like he is falling even further behind his classmates because of this and really dislikes the punishment. 

We are introduced to the UA school's top 3 students, who will explain further how they will train from now on, now that they have their provisional licenses.
