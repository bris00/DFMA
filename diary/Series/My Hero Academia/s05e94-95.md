First, the second match plays out. Yao is struggling to deal with the plans that her opposition has hatched. Even though their plan A failed and Fumikage uses his new flying powers, in the end class A loses to class B. And of course they won't shut up about it ðŸ˜†

A clutch mushroom in Fumikage's throat while Fumikage almost caught two of class B alone is what saved and in the end what made class B victorious.

The next match, match number 3, starts. Witch Shoto and Lida on the class A there is no way they will lose in my opinion. And it starts not great for class B when one of them loses their cool and just starts punching a path right towards the general direction of the class A team. But with some quick thinking, they manage to use it as a part of a plan that kinda works. Lida gets caught in some soft ice, but he has been practising hard at his quirk and barely manages to get out in time for what looks like a head on fight.
