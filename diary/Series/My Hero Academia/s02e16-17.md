We continue the sports festival, Izuku ends up winning the qualifying obstacle course miraculously by using an improvised scrap metal shield he found. He used it to cut off the arm of one of the first robot obstacles. And in the last obstacle, while Katsuki and Shoto were dragging each other down by bickering for first place, Izuku used his improvised shield to propel himself to first place by exploding the obstacle course's mines.

The second challenge is Cavalry Battle, they each get a headband that they must not let others steal. And they are on teams and have to ride each other. Izuku's headband is worth a ridiculous amount because he came in first place in the qualifier. Much more than seconds place's, therefore the game is really “who can get Izuku's headband”. However, Izuku gets a team with many flying quirks and is dodging many attempts by Katsuki and others. The episode ends there on a cliffhanger.
