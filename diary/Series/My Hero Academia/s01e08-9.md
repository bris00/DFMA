After Izuku won over Katsuki, the rest of the class fights it out. Then the class goes back to reflect on their mistakes and such. Except Izuku, who is wounded and has to go to the hospital. After Izuku heals and comes back, he finds Katsuki is leaving and then finds him. Izuku tried to encourage him, but really ends up stating that he will beat him. This does seem to motivate Katsuki to keep going, but who know what his true goal is. Later in class, they have to pick a class representative, and obviously everybody wants to. They decide to vote and Izuku wins with 3 votes. However, Izuku gives later gives this to the class' do-gooder who earlier managed to save everybody from panicking when an alarm went off. And Izuku can see he deserves it.

Prediction: One or more of the people in the class will end up being villains later in the show.
