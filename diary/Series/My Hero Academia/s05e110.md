Just when it's looking real bleak for the League of Villains, Twice gets over his psychological barrier and manages to use his quirk to the max. He duplicates himself so many times that Twices is overflowing the streets. This is enough to overpower all but the few really powerful enemies, and they start making their way to the tower where the Liberation Army boss is hold up.  A Twice Clone is the first one to reach the boss and duplicates himself a few times in order to put up a fight. He makes like 7 more clones, but they aren't a huge challenge for him. But they manage to stall for long enough that the cavalry arrives, including the giant, who tears down the tower.
