Izuku goes through his first day at the new school, his first class has a teacher that don't seem to like him much. I laughed pretty hard when he was introduced though, the sleeping bag was hilarious. The teacher has Izuku more or less figured out and sets him up to fail by creating a test and confronting Izuku about not being able to control his quirk. But Izuku bests him by just using a single finger for one of the tests 😆

I also can help but think the series has some sexual undertones, or maybe I'm just too horny. At some point the dialogue was “Octopuses are sexy”. Also the first episode had a pretty hot giantess showing off her ass. 🤷‍♂
