In the first episode of season 6 we get started by seeing Hawks getting deeper and deeper infiltrated into The Paranormal Liberation Front, he's making friends with Twice who has got the task of surveilling Hawks. But Twice is being very naive and confines in Hawks what is happening to Shigaraki at the hospital. 

Later we see the heroes plan for how they are going to stop The Paranormal Liberation Front, it involves a simultaneous attack on the hospital as well as a meeting The Paranormal Liberation Front is holding with all of their commanders. We see as they are making the first strike at the doctor, but turns out that's just a double. However, the doctor is actually residing at the hospital because of all the equipment and storage he needs for his experiments. It won't be long before a hero finds the real doctor. But there is an army of Nomu's fighting to protect him.
