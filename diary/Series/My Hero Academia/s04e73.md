Red Riot is pretty badly wounded from the fight, and it seems the super strong villain is still alive. However, the other is knocked out, and it seems to have released some form of control he had over the strong one. The strong one now seems no consider the fight a draw and walks away, asking them to fight again some other time. The others are still trying to catch up with Eri, but two of the guys from League of Villains are sent in to deal with them. While two is not a lot, they also manage to split the group into smaller groups that they can attack individually. They use more improvised walls to accomplish this. It seems pretty effective, and they manage to take out and stab one of the heroes, who falls unconscious. Deku and Eraser Head manage to break the wall and fight off the villain before she can do any more damage, and Deku runs to tend the hero's wounds.
