The Cavalry Battle continues, lots of action in this episode. Primarily between Izuku's team and Shoto's team. We also get to see Katsuki getting real angry on some contestants from class 1-B. Shoto's team eventually manages to get the headband from Izuku because Ida's quirk had a hidden trick he had not shown anyone yet. Then Izuku uses his quirk to try to get it back just in time, however Shoto uses his fire half for the first time in order to stop him. In the end, Shoto's team wins. However, Izuku manages to go through to the finale round because one of his teammates managed to get a different headband worth a lot during the chaos.
