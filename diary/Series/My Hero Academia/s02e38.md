The entire class pass the theoretical part of the final exam, however some did fail the practical part as such failed the exam. Because of this, the entire class gets to go to summer camp. Everyone needs to shop for stuff at the mall, and they decide to go as a group, except Baku and Shoto. However, when they get there, everybody spreads out to different stores. Even Uraraka runs away from Deku because she got embarrassed thinking about whether she's in love with Deku. Deku is left to his own as coincidentally the villain Shigaraki spots him and comes up close to talk. Shigaraki gets a grip around Deku that looks like they are friends, and threatens to kill Deku and many civilians if he makes a move before he would get caught by a hero at the mall. They have a long chat, and Deku makes Shigaraki realize what his convictions are. Uraraka saves  Deku by coming back to apologize for running off, and they call the police.
