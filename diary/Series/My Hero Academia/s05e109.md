The league of villains has travelled to the city where the Liberation Army is hold up. There, their plan seems to immediately crumble as they get lured into the city proper and gets attacked in the streets before the giant has had a chance to catch up with them. The fight does not go the way of the League of Villains even though Shigaraki is doing a good job, Toga and Twice are struggling. It does seem like maybe the Liberation Army is keen on recruiting one or both of Toga and Twice though, and they might be up to no good resurrection stuff?
