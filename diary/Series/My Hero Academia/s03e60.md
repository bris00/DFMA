Almost everyone from the UA class passed the second test as well as the first and got their provisional licence. They may now act as heroes and intervene in emergency situations. The only ones who did not get it were Todoroki and Baku, while we did not get to see the reason, my guess is Baku didn't get his because he went off alone and ran his mouth at the survivors. And Todoroki probably failed because he did not cooperate with the guy from the other school to take down the Orca. Thankfully, they all get another opportunity to get their provisional licence if they attend a course.  

Later, Baku has had enough of Deku and guesses from whom and how Deku got his quirk, and challenges him to a fight.
