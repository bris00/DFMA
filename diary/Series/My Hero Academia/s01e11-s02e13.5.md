These episodes were more or less one long epic fight against the villains, they're trying to survive long enough to get help. Eventually, All Might shows up to fight the 3 main villains, but he is at the limits of his power. All Might manages to fight one of them and stalls long enough for the other pro heroes to show up and cement their victory. Most of the students come out unharmed except Izuku who hurts himself like usual. All might also have to go to the school nurse, and two of the teachers are seriously hurt. One is the teacher who gave the class the test their first day.

Now that the first season is over, I wanted to declare my favourite scene from this season, because I think it deserves it. It was really well-made and stood out! The scene I'm talking about is the one where the villains arrive at the end of episode 9. The music was so well done and fit perfectly. And the way all the cool characters came through the portal was amazing to watch.
