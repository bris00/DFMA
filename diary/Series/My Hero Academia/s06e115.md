Mirko the rabbit hero is fighting like a champ against the nomus that the doctor has created. He even sets out three “High end” nomus that can even speak and think for them selves. Thankfully Mirko has managed to kill the pet nomus that can teleport. So There won't be an easy escape for the doctor and Shigaraki. The doctor however seems to be able to buy enough time to run over and release Shigaraki from his quirk bath. He might get scary if he is able to use his newfound powers.
