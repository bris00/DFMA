Mirko the rabbit hero is fighting like a champ against the nomus that the doctor has created. He even sets out three “High end” nomus that can even speak and think for them selves. Thankfully, Mirko has managed to kill the pet nomus that can teleport. So There won't be an easy escape for the doctor and Shigaraki. The doctor however seems to be able to buy enough time to run over and release Shigaraki from his quirk bath. He might get scary if he is able to use his newfound powers.

The support crew is running head on to the officer's meeting, it looks to be a head on clash as all the villains are running out too. Denki, is kinda afraid at being in the front lines, but gets his act together as he thinks of Jiro. Which is good as he then goes on to absorb what looks like a really powerful and wide hitting electricity quirk from a high ranking officer for the enemy.
