Bakugo and Uraraka fights it out. Uraraka has a plan to attack early in order to touch Bakugo and get an advantage in the air. But Bakugo has no mercy and attacks hard directly at Uraraka to the displeasure of the crowd. However Uraraka uses the debris from Bakugo's explosions in a secret plan, and gathers lots of it in the air, before unleashing a meteor shower on Bakugo. However Bakugo manages to fire an incredibly strong attack at the meteor shower, disintegrating the attack. By now, Uraraka has exerted herself way past her limits, but still tries to keep going. And passes out from overexertion. After she has healed, Izuku comes to visit, and she puts on a brave face, but afterwards while talking on the phone with her parents she starts crying because her family seems to be in trouble. She feels like she can't help them fast enough after losing the battle.

Then we get some setup for the next battle between Izuku and Shoto.
