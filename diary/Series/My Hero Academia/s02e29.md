Deku, Lida and Shoto tries to fight the Hero Killer one after another. Just when one falls, the next comes to the rescue. Lida didn't get much done though ðŸ¤­

Deku manages to use his quirk without hurting himself, and we get to see a few of what I assume are his powers. The smash we've already seen. But he is also jumping around in the air like Gran Torino does. The Hero Killer's quirk is freezing someone's body after tasting their blood. Deku manages to be frozen, but after a few minutes he can move again and rejoins the fight with Shoto. Shoto is amazing as always, and it seems like he has accepted both parts of himself and uses his fire in the fight without second thought. They are trying to draw out the time so that some more pro heroes will come help them. Lida was just about to wake up before the episode ended. I'm guessing he will redeem himself by carrying out the injured 3rd party. And allowing the students to flee to a more crowded place so that they can get some help.
