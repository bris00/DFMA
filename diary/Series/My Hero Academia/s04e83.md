The student have started practising for the festival, Deku is in the dancing team being taught by Mina. Eri comes to visit the school before the festival in order to socialize herself, since she's not used to society. Lemillion is the one bringing her, and he is acting very much like a dad. With his break from school, perhaps he will be Eri's foster parent. 

Gentle, the new villain, is finalizing his plans to ruin the UA schools festival. I think he's done something to the special tea that Deku and the others have got from Momo's mom, and pretty much everyone is drinking it. The question is what Gentle has done to is, sleeping serum perhaps?
