The finale is an elimination bracket tournament, where they will fight 1vs1, attempting to force the other into submission or pushing them outside the fighting ring. Izuku draws a guy from 1-B who's quirk is brainwashing. If he was a woman, I'd say that's pretty hot, and she could brainwash me any day. ðŸ˜†

Before the tournament starts there are some recreational games for the ones not in the final and somehow all the girls in the hero class has been fooled into putting on cheerleader uniforms. Izuku and Shoto meets and we learn Shoto's motivation to become the best hero. And why he is only using his right side. Shoto has inherited his right side from his mother and his left side from his father. And his father does not care about him as a person at all, only as a vessel to beat All Might. Therefore, Shoto dislikes his father and had made a promise to become the best hero without using the powers inherited from his father.

Izuku fights the brainwashing guy, but falls into his trap even though he got warned beforehand how it works. However, Izuku sees a vision from the past One for All wielders, and manages to break free from the brainwashing by damaging his fingers. Izuku then goes on to win the fight by avoiding his opponent's brainwashing.
