The third match concludes. We get an awesome display of power, Lida has become so strong, being even faster than Gran Torino. Shoto unleashes incredible heat in an attack his father would like, but Shoto is struggling mentally with. It turns into an endurance test between Shoto and Tetsutetsu. And in the end, everyone but one guy from each team gets knocked out from a last minute play by class B. The two left don't take any risks and ensure that the time runs out, making it a tie. Now it's up to Deku to save class A's honor.
