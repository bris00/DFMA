As Lemillion is driving Eri to the festival, Deku is out in the woods fighting Gentle. Deku has nailed down how Gentle quirk works and manages to outclass him and pin him to the ground. However, Gentles partner in crime uses her quirk to power up Gentle so that he overpowers Deku. The fight is a lot closer now, but eventually Deku manages to win and the backup comes. 

It seems like Gentle is going to prison now, which stops his lifelong dream to enter history. At least for now. I kinda liked Gentle, I think his and La Bravo's dynamic was interesting. And he seems like a better dude than some of the heroes that exist. However, he has been mistreated by society.
