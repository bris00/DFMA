The class has one of their lessons interrupted by a bunch of villains who has come to kill All Might. I have to say I really like how the villains were drawn. The style used was very creative and looked good without being generic. The kids end up fighting some side-villains in various groupings, and Izuku save a couple of the classmates. Izuku also takes a step in the right direction with regard to using his quirk without damaging himself too much. All Might is not there because he is hiding his weakness from the kids after saving too many people in town and exhausting his powers. The principal comes over to All Might's to have a talk about priorities and how he should now be focused on his student Izuku.
