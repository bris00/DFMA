The top 3 students present themselves to the class, they all seem somewhat strange personality wise, with one guy being so nervous he could not talk. However, one of the top 3 starts talking about what they should expect from their extracurricular activities. And he challenges the entire class to fight him alone. What they don't know is that he is one of the best fighters out there, even compared to pro heroes. Close to number 1. He can warp though solid objects and people, effortlessly dodging attacks by letting them move through his body. He can also move through the ground or through walls. Not only that, but he beats up the entire class and teaches them a lesson in humility, and a lesson in working hard. Even though most start by attributing his success to his quirk, they explain how he had to work hard to overcome the imitations and downsides to his quirk.
