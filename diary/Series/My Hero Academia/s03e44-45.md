Deku tried desperately to save everyone. First he has to get to Baku, but Dark Shadow has gone crazy and is in the way. But Deku and another classmate of his who is carrying him managed to lure Dark Shadow towards Baku and when they arrive Dark Shadow attacks the villain who is fighting Baku and Shoto. They start heading back, but a magician type steals Baku. However, Deku manages to improvise a human catapult to catch up with him. They have another fight with all the villains, but it ends up with Deku not being able to save Baku and the villains getting away with him, saved by the warp quirk.
