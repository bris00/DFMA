After taking down Gentle, Deku rushes back to the school so that he will be there in time for the show. Deku really wants to make this a good experience for Eri. Deku makes it just in time for the performance, where Lemillion and Eri are waiting in the crowd. We get a pretty nice show as the class is trying to win the competition, Eri even has her first smile watching the amazing show. A little later we also get to see the beauty competition where Hado puts on an incredible display, looking like a magical fairy.

Before Eri leaves, Deku gives her a candied apple which she likes a lot, and this also makes her smile! A very happy ending.

In the next episode, we see that Eri is going to move in to the UA school. In the teachers' dorm, this is to keep her quirk's power under control. Then the class gets a visit from some old friends, the pussycats have come to say hello. In the second half of the episode, we see the announcement and event for the Japanese Hero Billboard Chart rankings. The top 3 heroes get up on the podium, and we see some tension between Endeavour and an up-and-coming hero. Even still, Endeavour travels with this hero called Hawks when he asks for help checking out rumours of a Nomu in his town. Right before the episode ends, a Nomu comes crashing through the windows so the rumours seems to have some merit ðŸ˜†
