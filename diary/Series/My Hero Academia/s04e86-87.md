After taking down Gentle, Deku rushes back to the school so that he will be there in time for the show. Deku really wants to make this a good experience for Eri. Deku makes it just in time for the performance, where Lemillion and Eri are waiting in the crowd. We get a pretty nice show as the class is trying to win the competition, Eri even has her first smile watching the amazing show. A little later we also get to see the beauty competition where Hado puts on an incredible display, looking like a magical fairy.

Before Eri leaves, Deku gives her a candied apple which she likes a lot, and this also makes her smile! A very happy ending.
