This episode follows the 3 musketeers Deku, Todoroki and Baku on their fight against an artist during their internship at Endeavours. The artist has a quirk that makes him able to make anyone drop in an overpowering laughing fit anytime they look at him while he's using his quirk. It even works on robots!

In the end Endeavour trains Baku to fight blindfolded, and while they almost get him that way, Deku stops it and has a talk with him instead. And amazingly, it works. Deku has a knack for understanding people and their motivations, and is able to see what they need.
