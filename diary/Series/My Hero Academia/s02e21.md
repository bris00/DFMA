Most of the first bracket of the finals are played out in the episode, Izuku is taking notes on all of his classmates and obsesses over analysing their strengths and weaknesses. However, while doing this he neglects Uraraka, and don't even notice her going to the waiting room to prepare for her fight. She seems to be a bit sad and stressed from the ordeal. Eventually, Izuku notices she's gone, and heads down to help Uraraka.

The episode ends right before the start of Uraraka's fight against Katsuki, and everyone seems to think Uraraka will lose to Katsuki's raw power. But Uraraka seems like she has a trick up her sleeve, I'm partial to predicting she will win the fight somehow.
