The class is awed by the fight between Endeavour and the Nomu. It seems the fight has turned public opinions of Endeavour a little. It's a good start at least. Then the class gets an unexpected training scenario where they have to deal with some villains who have lit a building on fire. It seems like the students are fairly decent at organizing and splitting responsibilities / tasks. However, Baku goes off on his own like usual. It turns out the ones playing villains are the top 3 heroes, well top 2 now that Togata is quirkless and on leave. But Togata still participates by being a victim. The class handles the 2 villains fairly easily, but at the end, Baku does not shoot his shot because he does not want to hurt anyone on training. But holding back is not ideal either. Also, Baku fires a huge explosion after the drill is over, I'm sure we will see some consequences for these two next episode.
