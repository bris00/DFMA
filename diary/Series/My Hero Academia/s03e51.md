The students move into their new dorm, and the little perverted guy go absolutely crazy as they all decide to have a contest on who has the best room. But first they all have to deal with Aiziwa calling out Deku and his friends for trying to save Baku without permission. He said he would have normally expelled them all and whoever knew without saying anything to the teachers. But since the Symbol of Peace is dead, they need all the heroes they can get. Tsu also has a heartfelt conversation with Deku and his friends about how she felt when they went, and they all had a good cry.
