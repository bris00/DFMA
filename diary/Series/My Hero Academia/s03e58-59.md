Episode 58 was an interlude episode with a flashback to a summer class where Deku and a few others had to solve a murder mystery where All Might was playing the villain and got killed. 

In the next episode, when the fake villains attack Todoroki and the wind guy who hates Endeavour and Todoroki. It seems like a good plan as they are two of the strongest fighting students around and the others focus on saving more survivors.
