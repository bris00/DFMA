Episode 58 was an interlude episode with a flashback to a summer class where Deku and a few others had to solve a murder mystery where All Might was playing the villain and got killed. 

In the next episode, when the fake villains attack Todoroki and the wind guy who hates Endeavour and Todoroki. It seems like a good plan as they are two of the strongest fighting students around and the others focus on saving more survivors. However, when they try to use their quirks, they do everything to fuck it up by cancelling each of the others quirk. The Orca villain gets the upper hand and downs them both with his paralyzing quirk. But Todoroki and the hateful dude manages to cooperate a bit while they are both laying on the ground paralyzed. They create a whirlwind of fire to contain the Orca.
