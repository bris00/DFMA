Izuku and Katsuki fights it out in this episode and Izuku, who now maybe prefers to be called Deku, finally expresses some of his pent-up feelings about Katsuki from their childhood and school-years. Izuku manages to distract Katsuki in hand-to-hand combat long enough to make a plan on how to win. The plan is for his teammate to go get the weapon while Izuku fights Katsuki far enough away from the weapon so that it does not become a 2 vs 2, then he will join his teammate after beating Katsuki. Izuku looks to be doing good, but then Katsuki uses his quirk dangerously to knock over Izuku. Izuku avoids using his because he still can't without hurting himself. But he just manages to get by long enough to get a final blow though the roofs, allowing his teammate to use her quirk and win the game.
