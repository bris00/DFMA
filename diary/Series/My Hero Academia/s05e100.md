Deku is dealing with the aftermath of the games. Everyone saw him using a new quirk, but he convinces them that if was just a new manifestaion of his old one. And he and Baku fights in order to try to trigger it since Baku already knows about Deku and All Might they explain what happening to him.

They also try to copy Eri's quirk with that guy from class B who can copy quirks. However like with Deku's quirk he just draws a blank. Deku gets a little explainations of how that works too.
