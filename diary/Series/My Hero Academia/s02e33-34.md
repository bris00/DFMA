All Might tells Deku about the history of how the One for All came to be, how is started as a rivalry between two brothers. One who was the BBEG of the early ages, and his brother who did not approve. The brother was quirkless, but in actually he had the quirk to pass on quirks. His brother the BBEG had the quirk of stealing quirks and giving them to himself or others. When the BEEG brother gave a quirk to his brother, he used it to fight against his brother. And he passed on his quirk in a line to fight the good fight. His brother became ageless, and the fight has gone on since. However, All Might “managed”, but not really, to finally defeat him. But he has arisen as the mastermind behind the League of Villains.

Later, the students are preparing for the final exam of the first year. It's part practical and part theoretical. For his practical exam Deku has to team up with Bakugo to fight All Might
