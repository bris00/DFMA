A freelance journalist is investigating All Might and who his apprentice is. He contacts a local newspaper to gain access to the UA students and is granted this on the basis that the parents would like to see for themselves and get to know how the students are doing at the dorm. 

The journalist has his sights set on Deku's class and quickly isolates Deku as the most likely alternative. He starts talking and prodding at Deku in order to verify his gut feeling, and when confronted, Deku does not have a great poker face. But it seems like the journalist is genuinely interested in knowing who the apprentice is because he wants hope after All Mights fall, and he is a fan of All Might, like Deku is. Even though he figures Deku out, he does not write the story or sell it to the newspaper. The secret is safe for a little while longer, but it is starting to fall apart. If a journalist can figure it out, so can others.
