Shoto and Bakugo fights it out, Bakugo does not manage to get Shoto to use his left side, but Bakugo does end up winning the match after a decent explosion. Shoto is conflicted about wheather or not he wants to use his left side and after the medal ceremony he leaves to visit his mom in hospital/ward for the first time after she had a breakdown and burnt him. Bakugo is getting more and more crazy and seems to be lining up for either a redemption arc or a villain arc. Lida visits his brother in hospital after he lost a fight to the Hero Killer and seems to be in a really bad condition.
