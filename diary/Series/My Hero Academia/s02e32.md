Deku is still hospitalised, but we get to see some of the other students' internships. The main internship we get to see is Froppy's. She's interning at a ship that's supporting the coast guard. She's delegated to cleaning the deck. They finally get a call from the coast guard to help capture a villain who has stolen some goods. However, when they manage to spot the boat Froppy is ordered to stay back by the captain. Which upsets her. When the captain and his chosen helper gets fooled and captured it is up to Froppy and her supervisor to go after the bad guys. Thanks to Froppy they manage to hold out and let the captain, who eventually escapes, know where they are. The captain then comes to save them. But he is very impressed by Froppy. And they seem to want her to work there after her education
