The league of villains meets the giant All for One has under his control, but it is not a friendly meeting. The giant is very disappointed in the successor, Shigaraki, and starts fighting the league. However, they are teleported to a secret location where a doctor and old partner of All of One resides. It seems like Shigaraki also knows the doctor from the time All for One raised him. He explains that he will help the league if they can prove themselves worthy but taking down the giant. 

Back fighting the giant, the league is struggling, but surviving. The giant is slow so dodging the attacks is possible, and the fight drags out days, only interrupted by short sleeps. Eventually Shigaraki gets the idea to pit the giant against the Liberation Army, who seems to have some beef with the League of Villains.
