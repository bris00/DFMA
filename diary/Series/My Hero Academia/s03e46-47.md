Deku and some of his friends are planning how to save Baku, even though they know they are not allowed to use their quirks for violence yet. Lida tries hard to stop them, but in the end he can only join them in order to try to keep them out of trouble. Their plan is to covertly save Baku without any fighting. But this seems very unlikely. At the same time, pretty much every known pro hero is also planning on breaking out Baku. 

We see a little from Baku's perspective, and the villains are trying to convince him to join them. Baku is resisting though and thinking about how All Might managed to fight against many opponents, he breaks free and causes a rackle. But as Baku had predicted, the villains don't want to kill him, as he seems useful to them.
