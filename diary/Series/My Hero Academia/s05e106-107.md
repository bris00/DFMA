After the dinner at the Todoroki family Deku, Baku, Endeavor, Shoto and Endeavor's driver are driving home when they are stopped by some guy causing trouble. However, this time its not some arbitrary villain. It's someone who seems obsessed with Endeavor. His great desire is to be killed by Endeavor in combat, and to accomplish this he has been stalking Endeavor's family. After the dinner, he kidnapped Shoto's big brother and is now threatening to kill him if Endeavor does not kill him first. 

Endeavor is quick to the scene as always but he cannot use his raw strength like usual because he is emotionally attached to the victim and afraid to hurt him. Thankfully Deku, Baku and Shoto picks up the slack and manages to save the day. Deku even learned to control his whip quirk.

Endeavor has a good talk with Shoto's brother for probably the first time in 20 years and it seems like there is now a road ahead to repair their relationship. Not a paved road perhaps, but a road none the less.
