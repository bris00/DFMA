So today I've seen Izuku go through a training montage in order to contain and use All Mights power. Eventually he finishes just in time and All Might gives him a strand of his hair for Izuku to eat. Izuku then participates in the entrance exam for the UA school, but scores 0 points on the practical exam. But he does act heroic and saves a cute girl he likes and this earns him some hidden points for saving someone, and he manages to pass the exam.
