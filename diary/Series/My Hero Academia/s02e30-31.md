Deku, Lida and Shoto has an epic fight with the Hero Killer and eventually manage to take him down by cooperating. They only managed it after Deku and Shoto dragged the fight out long enough for Lida to move and join the fight.

Right after the took down the Hero Killer, the rest of the pro Heroes found the alleyway and took over. However, one of the League of Villains multi-quirk creatures called Nomus came and picked up Deku, flying him away.  But the Hero Killer saved Deku.

In the aftermath, the school and everyone else worries about the Hero Killers ideology spreading and causing mass recruitment into the League of Villains.
