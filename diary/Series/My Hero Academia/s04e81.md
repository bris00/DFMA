The class finds out they are going to have to participate in a School Festival. And not only that, but they also have to come up with something to bring as a class to the festival. They spend most of the day trying to agree on what they should do, as they all have 100 mediocre ideas ðŸ˜†
They end up deciding on doing a live performance and dance. Can't wait to see what that will look like haha. 

Deku and Lemillion is allowed to come and visit Eri, and they have a good talk, however it seems like Eri is unable to smile and Deku feels like Overhaul still has some influence over Eri's thoughts.

At the end we see some mysterious guy who I'm sure we will see more of, he has a glorious moustache.
