Endeavour is fighting against the blackened Nomu that has insane regeneration powers. He gets some help from Hawks. At some point I was convinced that Endeavour was going to die, but Endeavour is a stubborn one. Endeavour found the strength he needed from thinking about his motivations and what he sacrificed to get to where he is. And everything has got accumulated to this moment where he cannot fail or all will be for nothing.
