Endeavour is fighting against the blackened Nomu that has insane regeneration powers. He gets some help from Hawks. At some point I was convinced that Endeavour was going to die, but Endeavour is a stubborn one. Endeavour found the strength he needed from thinking about his motivations and what he sacrificed to get to where he is. And everything has got accumulated to this moment where he cannot fail or all will be for nothing. With the strength from this plus some extra power from Hawks Endeavour manages to defeat the Nomu just about. He stands in a victory pose for the cameras after as a show of force and to reignite the symbol.

I'm not sure how I feel about Endeavour surviving, at some point I kinda wanted it and felt it would be fitting for his character. I also like shows where people who are outmatched or outsmarted die. Consequences for the characters actions. But who knows, maybe Endeavour will have a large part in the future that will unfold.
