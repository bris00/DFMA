The class is thrown into the second provisional test together with the rest of the ones who passed the first test. All in all, 100 aspiring heroes are tasked with saving the paid survivors from a fake terrorist attack. Deku quickly learns that his attitude matters when rescuing panicked and frightened people. The other classes seem to have a lot of experience and immediately gets to establishing zones and triaging people. The UA class is a bit slower, but they eventually get into a rhythm after splitting up into teams of 3 to 4 people. But then the fake villains are released into the arena, and they will have to deal with fighting at the same time as rescuing people.
