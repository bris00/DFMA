Deku tried to find a spot for his work study, but Gran Torino does not want Deku and tells him to use All Mights connections to get one instead. However, it seems like All Might has had a falling out with his former sidekick Nighteye, who is the logical place for Deku to go. So All Might gets the number one student who is already interning at Nighteye's to put in a word for Deku.

When Deku shows up Nighteye is stern and does not want Deku to work there, he also seems to have a ticketing fetish since he has his assistant bound up and is tickling her ðŸ¤£

Nighteye challenges Deku to take the stamp away from him, but this is a very challenging task since Nighteye's quirk is one of foresight. And he can predict all of Deku's actions. But even though he fails, Deku impresses Nighteye enough that Nighteye accepts Deku into the agency.
