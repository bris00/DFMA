Hawks is doing some more spying for a group of villains. They have equipped him with a bunch of surveillance equipment in order to get access to the hero network. Presumably this was sprung on Hawks last minute as a surprise to see his alignment, but he did not reveal his hand and agreed to wear the equipment. Hawks tried to warn Endeavour of this group's plans and number subtly, since everything he does electronically or audible is now surveilled by the very same group. Hawks does this by encoding a message in highlights in a book he hands to Endeavour and Endeavour learns when they will attack, and that they have thousands of members.
