After being taunted pretty hard by the League of Villain extras, the guy who is controlling the building snaps and creates chaos. However, this gives Deku an opportunity to find out where in the roof he is hiding and kicks the roof, so he becomes vulnerable. Eraser Head notices and removes his quick, and everything clams down. They've managed to remove the biggest obstacle to catching up to overhaul and Eri.

Lemillion meanwhile has managed to catch up on account of him going through all the walls, he fights a long and epic fight against all odds. Overhaul is abusing the fact that Lemillion cannot use his quirk as effectively while protecting Eri. He is constantly switching between targeting Lemillion and Eri. In the end, Lemillion gets shot by one of the bullets that removes quirks and has to fight without it. But he musters all he has, keeps going, while Eri is watching in disbelief.
