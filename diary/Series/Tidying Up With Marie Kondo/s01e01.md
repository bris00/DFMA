I did not have much time today before the games at 10pm, so I chose the only show left on Netflix just so that I would not be stuck an hour looking for the shows. So I picked Tidying Up With Marie Kondo. I'm not a big fan of reality shows, but I was interested in tidying, and if there were any good tips as it is an area where I could use some inspiration. I must admit, I got a bit curious whether the family actually got better, or if they just cleaned up for her arrival at the end. A surprise visit would be fun ðŸ˜†

The family seemed nice, but there was obviously some tension because of the mess left behind by the wife while she took care of the kids and the husband was working. Hopefully they managed to work out a system that worked for them.

Marie was also an interesting character, she had a very intricate approach to the house and seems to try to find ways to enjoy cleaning. Rather than a way to get it done quickly, might not be such a dumb idea.
