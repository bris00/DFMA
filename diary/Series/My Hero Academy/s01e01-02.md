I watched an episode of My Hero Academy this morning and I enjoyed so much that I watched another episode and a half at the gym. I'm not much of a fan of traditional superhero movies/series, except a few, but I feel like MHA has a pretty unique take that I enjoyed a lot. In their world almost everybody has superpowers or “quirks”, and for the first episodes we're following one of the few without any special quirks. The series being anime also helps set it apart from other superhero franchises in my mind. 

We're following a kid, Izuku, whose bullied at school for not having any powers, but he wants nothing more in the world than to be a hero. He wants to apply for the best and most prestigious hero school, but realistically he has no chance without any quirks. Not even his mother believes he could become a hero. Eventually, he meets his biggest model hero after he saves him. He gets an opportunity to ask if he can become a hero without any quirks, but the response was not positive. However, later a large attack happens, but all the heroes are unable to help. Seeing that its his classmate and bully thats in trouble, Izuku runs to help him even though many "real" hearoes are just waiting.
