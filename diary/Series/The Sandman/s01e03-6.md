I had a lazy Sunday, so I've watched 3 episodes today. I think the show is pretty good, and I almost ended up binging a few more episodes. It's hard to summarize all the episodes, but part of why I like it is that each episode is pretty unique. I don't think there has been two where we have had to“endure” the same setting. However, despite this, they manage to tie the episodes together satisfyingly. The biggest negative for me so far is the way Dream seems very detached or edgy. Maybe they will explain this eventually, but for now I feel like he has just been taken from a 2010's vampire series. On the positive side, I really enjoyed the way they portray the gods of traditionally “evil” domains in a good light. Like the way Death is actually a caring being who's there for people at the end. And death is natural and even necessary for the benefit of humanity. I also liked the way they approached the topic of eternal life, I am curious weather (Ken?) will eventually ask Dream to end his life. I'm not sure at all where the story is going to go now, seems like Dream is at a point where he has got back his power and needs to find a new bad guy to deal with. Perhaps we will see more of the nightmare without eyes.
