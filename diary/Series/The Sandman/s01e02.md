I liked episode 2 more than 1 I feel like. It seems like things slowed down a bit, and I was more engaged throughout. I liked the Cain and Abel characters, but I am a bit confused now about whether religion is going to play a larger part of the series in the future. It might seem like my prediction about Ethel's son is going to be wrong since he “only” got the amulet, but I suppose there is still a chance. The-one-who-is-three was a fun scene, and I was very surprised when they deep throated the snake 😄 I kinda felt like watching the next episode, but I was a bit sleepy, so I had a nap instead 😆 But I think that's a good sign for the series, and I'll for sure be watching again tomorrow.

As for new predictions, it's a hard one. Even though he's old and in prison/hospital now, I don't think we've seen the last of Ethel's son. I think he has, or holds, a secret. And might hunt for more artefacts.
