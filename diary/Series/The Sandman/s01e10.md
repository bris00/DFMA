So Dream finally managed to catch the Corinthian in this episode. He also found out the Desire was behind Rose being the vortex in an apparent attempt to make Dream kill a member of his own blood/family. They didn't really explain why this would be bad, but I'm hoping they will flesh out that plot line in subsequent episodes. Dream gave Desire some vauge threats like thats going to help ðŸ˜†

Also, I couldn't help but think about Miss Ana during this episode when all of Rose's friends were gathered in the same dream. Since, Miss Ana has said she dreams vividly about other people in her life. And I imagined Barbie as Miss Ana and Ken as Dee when Barbie was upset at Ken for what he did in the dream ðŸ˜„
