I watched an episode of The Sandman whilst working out at the gym today. In this episode, we saw the dream world being damaged by Rose and her friends as they used Rose's powers to cheat death. Rose also found Jeb and both missing forces of nature. Unfortunately, she “found” Jeb at the serial killer conference and one of the comically bad, bad guys, had taken him. The episode ended on a cliffhanger, where Corinthian saved Rose and Jeb from the serial killer. But he probably has no good intentions himself.
