I watched episode 1 of The Sandman as part of my task today, Miss Ana. Iâ€™m not sure quite what I think about it yet. I think it has potential for sure. But it didnâ€™t completely capture me either. I enjoyed seeing Charles Dance again! I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve seen him since GoT. I liked his dynamic with Alex as well. Alexâ€™s story in general was good. But I did feel a bit like the story moved very fast, and I didnâ€™t get to know everyone as well as I would have liked. And I would have liked episode 1 to be at least two episodes with less narration. Overall, I'll give it 7/10 and I think I will watch the next episode ðŸ˜„

As for predictions, itâ€™s a bit hard as most of them came true during the episode. All Iâ€™ve got is that maybe Ethelâ€™s son is going to become an important character and will wear The Dreamâ€™s mask at some point.
