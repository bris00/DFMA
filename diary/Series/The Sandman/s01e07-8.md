I watched another couple of episodes after work today. We're now following Rose “The Vortex” and her search for her brother who's living with his abusive foster parents. Hopefully she will soon find him, but last I was he was kidnapped by Corinthian, so might be a little while. Corinthian might also be showing up at a serial killer club, that's bound to be interesting. Dream has found one of his three missing Nightmares. Also Lyta got dream-pregnant, don't know where they are go with all of these storylines, but they seem to have a knack for weaving together the oddest of threads.
