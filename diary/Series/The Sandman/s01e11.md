Finished the last episode on netflix. This one was very strange in a good way. We did not see any characters from previous except Dream and the episode started with a cat animation foreshadowing the cat takeover of the world. Dream rescued his ex-wife and mother of his son from an author who used her for inspiration for his book. Overall, a pretty surreal episode.

It does not seem like the story is wrapping up at all, so I'm hoping they're making another season soon.
