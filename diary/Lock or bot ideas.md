Me and T2 may agree on playing a game, or Miss Ana may at any time select a game we have to play. After a game has been selected we will each decide how much we want to bet on that game, to keep it fair when one has an advantage over the other. The house will multiply our bets by a factor rounded down to incentivise adding to the pot. The house may set a maximum bet to avoid all-ins. Some games may forgo betting all together if they have custom rules for amount added/removed (like guess a number or poker). 

For example if both our locks start at 100 days and I bet 10 days and T2 bets 15 days we would respectively end up at 110 days and 115 days. Lets say the house multiplies by 10% so the pot is `(10+15)*1.1=27.5` which all goes to the winner, in this case say T2 wins and his lock is adjusted to 88 days while mine stays at 110.
