Dear Miss Ana,

This is the second part of my letter to you. I hope this letter finds you well, even if a bit late, thank you for the patience you have shown me regarding getting this letter to you. 

When I watch you interact with others in the chaster server, I get this feeling of being proud to be your lockee. I see you acting so selfless, and I see how much you care about the people you talk with, and you genuinely try to help them. You are awesome to do this for anyone, regardless of how well you know them. You're a giver, and I even sometimes worry that you give too much of yourself. 

I love how you are not just a great Domme, but we also can talk about other non-kinky topics. You are knowledgeable about so many topics, and you know how to keep a conversation going. I could listen to you talk about your interests forever, whether it's games, K-pop, anime, or your cat. 

I also have to admit that I'm totally smitten by your looks, I have been keeping the picture of you with your leather boots on as my phone's wallpaper ever since I asked for permission. Every time I open my phone, I'm reminded of how absolutely stunning you look, Miss Ana. At first, I was afraid that I would get “used” to the wallpaper and would forget to hide it while someone was watching. That has not happened because I get this shock and awe feeling running through me each time I see that picture. Reminding me both that I'm yours, but also that I should be discreet with showing my background in public. 

That is just one picture of you Miss Ana, if I was to compliment your appearance in ever picture we would be here all day, but I also want to mention how colourful you look in one of the pictures! It suits your colourful personality so well, I especially love the purple colour at the end of your hair. 

Something that might traditionally be difficult to mention in a letter of praise, but that I feel like you deserve to be praised for, is that way that can be cruel and mean to me Miss Ana. My greatest desire is to feel out of control, and you elegantly provide me with that when you convince or make me do mean things. The best example so far being giving me a chance to cum if I wore my spiked cage at max. But you manage to do this, you manage to allow me to explore the feeling of being out of control, while at the same time making me feel cared for and valued. That takes a lot of effort from your side, unless you're just a natural talent, and I appreciate it so very much, Miss Ana.

With all my heart,
Your needy simp,

Bris
