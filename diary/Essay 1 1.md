Dear Miss Ana,

This is the second part of my letter to you. I hope this letter finds you well eventually, thank you for being so patient with me when it comes to getting this to you. 

When I watch you interact with others in the chaster server, I get this feeling of proudness to be your lockee when I see this. I see how much you care about the people you talk with, and you genuinely try to help them. You are selfless to do this for anyone, regardless of how well you know them. You're a giver, and I sometimes worry that you give too much of yourself. 

[About being strict and mean]
