Dear Miss Ana,

This is the second part of my letter to you. I hope this letter finds you well eventually, thank you for being so patient with me when it comes to getting this to you. 

When I watch you interact with others in the chaster server, I get this feeling of being proud to be your lockee when I see you acting so selfless. I see how much you care about the people you talk with, and you genuinely try to help them. You are awesome to do this for anyone, regardless of how well you know them. You're a giver, and I even sometimes worry that you give too much of yourself. 

I love how you are not just a great Domme, but we also can talk about other non-kinky topics. You are knowledgeable about so many topics, and you know how to keep a conversation going. I could listen to you talk about your interests forever, whether it's games, k-pop or your cat. 

I also have to admit that I'm totally smitten by your looks, I have been keeping the picture of you with your leather boots on as my wallpaper ever since I asked and every time I open my phone I'm reminded of how absolutely amazing you look Miss Ana. At first, I was afraid that I would get "used" to the wallpaper and would forget to hide it while someone was watching. That has not happened because I get this shock and awe feeling running through me each time I see that picture. Reminding me both that I'm yours, but also that I should be discreet with showing my background in public. 

[About being strict and mean]
