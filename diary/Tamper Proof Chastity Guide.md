## General Idea

The idea of the tamperproof chastity is to make it so that there is no way to pull out of a ball-trap chastity device without leaving a trace that will be visible in a photo of the device. It accomplices this by wrapping a ribbon around the penis inside the cage in such a way that inserting the penis back into the ribbon is impossible. Combined with a way to ensure that the ribbon is not swapped.

## Required equipment

* Chastity ball-trap device with restricted access to move and poke inside the cage. And a couple of holes to tie the ribbon through. I've tried a few cages without any luck until [this](https://bit.ly/3UAHrS9) specific cage turned out to be perfect for the task.
* Some ribbon material that will stand up to some wear and tear. And it should be possible to create a hole in it. I went with a type of plastic ribbon called “Surveyor's tape” or often just “Non-adhesive PVC tape”.
* A way to create a sturdy hole in the ribbon. I've successfully used an eyelet punch press.

## Assembly

Cut a piece of the ribbon to size, bunch up the ribbon a bit and wrap another piece around a couple of times. This will make the hole sturdier so that it hopefully won't accidentally tear. Use the hole punch to create a hole in the ribbon to tread a plastic one-time-lock through. The purpose of this is to be bale to verify that the lockee has not swapped the entire ribbon whilst caged.

Now pull the ribbon through the holes in the cage.

Then tie the ribbon off around the penis, this may be difficult to do right without a cage with horizontal bars. Make sure the ribbon is tied somewhat tight, but not so tight as to cause discomfort when wearing. The purpose of tying it tight is so that it won't be possible to open the knot and retie the ribbon again.

Cut the ribbon close to the knot so that there won't be any slack to pull on and/or manipulate. This would make it easier to cheat, and it looks better.

## How to verify

The setup needs to be verified at least two times per unlock. Once before unlocking in order to ensure that the ribbon has not been tampered with.

* The plastic lock is intact and has the correct number.
* The ribbon is fully around the penis, not squished in front or wherever it's tied to the cage.

And after they unlock, the setup needs to be verified so that the ribbon is installed correctly and in a way where the lockee cannot reinsert into the ribbon.

## Potential problems

* Natural wear and tear, causing the ribbon to be ruined, or more likely the hole in the ribbon to fail.
