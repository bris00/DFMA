I managed to somewhat break my cage, Miss Ana was very kind and let me use a hygiene unlock a few hours early so that I would not have to suffer the uncomfortable cage any longer than I already had. No damage done to me :)

During the hygiene unlock I cleaned up myself, shaved and relocked in my cobra cage. Then I completed task #3 and submitted a new task idea to Miss Ana. (5/100 points)

After the task, I thought of a way to try to make Miss Ana smile by writing some lines on writeforme.org. I set the goal number of lines to 10 and each error to add another line. I chose the line:

`I want to simp for Miss Ana. Rule number 1 is "I must always refer to Miss Ana as Miss Ana, or Ana-sensei". Rule number 2 is "I must message Miss Ana at least once a day with the aim of making her smile". Rule number 3 is "I must strive to send Miss Ana messages without expecting a response"`

Unfortunately, I did not make it through all the lines as I was making lots of mistakes, and it was getting late. Maybe I will try again later.
