I spent like 1h and 45 min uncaged trying to install the spout today ðŸ˜†

I did manage to rotate and assemble everything they way it's supposed to be, but the rings I used were too small I think, and I could slide it out if I pulled a little on it. The largest I got assembled was 13Â mm and I still have the next size up, 14Â mm, to try. But I think I will leave that for tomorrow, since I'm feeling a bit sore. And I already exceeded the allowed time to test the new cage, even though I got permission I don't want to push it tooo much. 

The cage without spout is feeling great though!
