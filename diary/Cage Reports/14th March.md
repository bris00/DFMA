I tried out the new cage before bed last night! It's really sturdy and pretty(I posted some pictures in #chastity-devices if you're curious + my verification this morning). I love how metal cages do not yield at all compared to the flex of plastic cages. But my problem with metal was always how heavy they are. But this one is really light because it's made of titanium, which is lighter than steel, but more or less equally strong. 

The fit was great, and it barely did that thing where cages migrate down and away from the body when really aroused/at night. I wore is all night without problem, and I'm testing it at work today.

I did not try it with the spout yet, saving that for today when I have plenty of time ðŸ˜„
