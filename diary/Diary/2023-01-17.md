# Tuesday, January 17
I managed to finish a rough first version of the share link app for Miss Ana. There is still more work to be done, but I think it is in a state where it can be tested. I also added some nice welcome messages to the front page as a surprise (I hope Miss Ana found it in the app before reading this). I also asked Nici and Borealis for some messages, and I got a few from Nici.

Tomorrow is the scheduled release of the lock. I'm excited to find out what happens. I'm getting close to the point where I'd really like to release, but this many days also has made me very submissive. I want to follow whatever Miss Ana wants from me, whether that unlocking and taking a break or keep going. 

And lastly I made a final task for Miss Ana, I have a feeling she might like it. And that brings me to 100/100 points. Just in time!
