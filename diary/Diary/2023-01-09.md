# Monday, January 9

I have had a fairy calm day kink wise today. The day started with a somewhat interesting train ride to work. I got flustered and could not stop thinking about Miss Ana or my situation. Maybe I will confess my thoughts soon if I'm feeling brave. At work my cage was very itchy after shaving yesterday, so I used a hygiene unlock when I got home to swap into a more comfortable cage. Otherwise, I was extremely horny when I got home from work, and I had a hard time stopping looking at pretty pictures in various discord channels. Eventually I managed to get up to make dinner and I felt less horny afterwards. I spend an hour or so working on the lockbox project, but I was a bit distracted and did not make any real progress, so I'm not counting it towards my points.
