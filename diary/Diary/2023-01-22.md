# Sunday, January 22

I started the day by cutting up a bunch of chillies to make some homemade chilli flakes. Unfortunately, I managed to rub my nether region somehow afterwards, so I spend about 30 minutes with a burning sensation down there. It would have probably made a pretty good punishment task ðŸ˜† I can imagine my keys being released after I had handled chillies, and therefore I would have very little interest in touching to unlock, let alone to stoke ðŸ˜Š

Otherwise, the day was spent just having a lazy Sunday, I started to miss Miss Ana, but I had heard in chat she had attended a megagame, so I assumed she was tired and relaxing herself. Thankfully, she showed up later for a quick chat, which I appreciated. 

I watched a lot of The Sandman episodes, I think I've started to enjoy it quite a bit now. I'll probably watch the rest at a decent pace. In addition to the watching task, I listened to some K-pop while cleaning my flat for over an hour. I have to admit to not being the biggest fan of K-pop or pop in general, but I will try to find some new songs I like at least. I know there are good (to me) K-pop songs out there. From the get-go, I know I enjoy VILLIAN.
