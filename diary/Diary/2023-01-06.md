## Friday January 6

Today was a pretty calm day for me, after work I was a bit foolish and wanted some more time since I could tell the lock's time would be over before I finished my points anyway. So I poked Miss Ana a bit with a question and got what I wanted. I did not expect Miss Ana to add 10 days, though. I admit it turned me on, but also I might have to be a bit more careful i the future ðŸ˜†

On the positive side, I have plenty of time to finish my tasks now, and it's getting a bit late, so I think I will save my next task idea for tomorrow and make sure it gets the time it deserves.

I was browsing the #chastity-devices channel and found a cage I really liked, but I'm a bit worried about whether it'll be comfortable enough to wear. Maybe Miss Ana likes it? I'll ask her in my goodnight message, I think.

There was a lot of talk about spiked cages today in the discord, so I got a bit curious about my old spiked cages. I think I have two with those extra rings that have spikes. I think I give it another try tonight to please Miss Ana.
