# Monday, January 23

I spent some time today after work trying to figure out the digital lock I have. I'm bashing my head against a metaphorical wall, but that's the kind of thing I enjoy when programming. I do hope I'll make some progress, though, as it would be fun to be able to use a proper secure lockbox for chaster. I also got API keys yesterday so that means I could make an extension for chaster. Could be any extension really, not just for my lockbox either.

Also gave my share link to jhey for shits-and-giggles, well see how long he remembers to add to it for ðŸ˜† Otherwise I did the usual tasks, watched The Sandman and send Miss Ana a photo I hope will make her smile. Tomorrow I will try to do my first workout task, if I can remember to bring my guy equipment to work. I always have so little time in the mornings, I procrastinate getting out of bed until the last possible moment. Feels so good laying under the duvet, warm and cosy. Occasionally browsing some pretty femdom porn ðŸ˜Š
