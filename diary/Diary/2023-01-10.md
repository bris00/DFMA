# Tuesday, January 10

Another calm day, I managed to get a couple of tasks done today, first I did some research on s subject Miss Ana likes. I chose anime and found some information on how anime is made(45/100 points). Then I did task-2, which is thanking Miss Ana for locking me. But I feel like it's a bit too easy to just write it to Miss Ana, so to make it a bit more personal and unique I made it a short voice recording. I know for me, I really feel like sounds makes digital everythings come alive. So I hope it is something Miss Ana will enjoy hearing. Hopefully making her control feel more real to her, because it is(50/100 points).
