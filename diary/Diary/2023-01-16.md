# Sunday, January 15

Today has been a challenge, I've been very horny after work today for some reason. And when I'm like this I of course watch some femdom porn like that going to help. I don't know what to do with myself.

I did manage to spend a few hours working on Miss Ana's program, it's quite fun work, actually. Although I'm struggling the most with styling 😆 I have the entire login flow finished now, I just need the logic for adding time to locks before it's a prototype. After that there is probably some polishing the UI and handling some error cases. I'm at 90 task points now 🥳 I've been thinking if I should try to do some other tasks than “Developer's Boon”. But after thinking about it for a bit, I figured that I'll hopefully have plenty of time to do the other tasks when I'm done with this one. Plus, I think this is the most useful task I can do for Miss Ana. 

I'm still healing from the small injury I found yesterday, It seems to be healing nicely even though I'm caged, so I'm not worried. 

I also made some plans for Wednesday and Tuesday, right when the lock is scheduled to finish. Nice timing by me 😆
