# Friday, January 13

I experimented a bit with a setup to achieve tamperproof chastity during my hygiene unlock today, and it's working a bit too well. I talked to Miss Ana about it and to my great pleasure it seems like she's also interested. Hopefully this will be a step to giving up some real control to Miss Ana! Chastity is already fun, and I can't wait for the possibility of it being practically inescapable without consequences. I made a little [[Tamper Proof Chastity Guide]] with some pictures to explain how it all works.

I also asked Miss Ana if I could try the ‚ÄúFrustrated Hero‚Äù task today. Being her kind self, Miss Ana allowed me to try. I have to say, it was a really incredible experience. I had chosen this [video](https://spankbang.com/4qaho/video/cock+hero+filthy+cute+challenge+mode) and I felt immediately very horny and good. By the end I was feeling even more horny but like I had too much. The horny almost became a punishment. There were multiple times during the stroking where I felt like I was building up something and the desire to stroke faster came over me. Just like it does when stroking for real and approaching orgasm. But this time nothing happened when I increased the tempo or stroked with more pressure. Which just caused me to want it even more. Especially frustrating when watching the video where they were building up to orgasms and giving facials.

After the ordeal I noticed I had been leaking some precum and took some pictures and a video to remember it by. But after I put down the camera, another bunch of precum came out. It was totally clear, so I know I didn't come. Not that I was close, but I have never ever leaked that much before.

I also did a task I get points for today, on the train ride home from work today I continued working of the lockbox reversing. I've realized I probably need to inspect the network traffic, but it is encrypted. So I've been working on setting up my emulator with a network inspector that can MITM tls traffic with its own self-signed certificate. Miss Ana also told me she wanted me to switch focus to an app that would add time to chaster share links üòÑ So I spent a bit of time on that as well before bed. Hopefully it'll go smooth, and I'll be able to surprise Miss Ana with it soon.
