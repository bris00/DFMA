# Saturday, January 21

I had a calm day at home today, Miss Ana was away for most of the day, and I was pretty tired from all of my long days the last week, so I slept a bit in the evening. I dealt with some frustrating IT problems I've been having and otherwise doing nothing much at all. I had wanted to look a bit more into the digital lock, but I did not get that far. Hopefully tomorrow!

I ended up doing the same tasks as yesterday since I'm planning on working out at work, so not in the weekends, and because I've not yet logged in to spotify on my new phone. Passwords are so annoying, I still have to move them over from my old phone. I watched episode 2 of The Sandman which I thought was better than episode 1. And I also tried to spank myself until I turned a bit red. I don't mark easily though, and I had delayed until I had too little time, so I did not get as red as I would like. But it did hurt ðŸ˜†
