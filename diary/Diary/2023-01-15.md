# Sunday, January 15

I've been having a good day at home, doing nothing much today. I've been cleaning up my flat and working a bit on the bot for Miss Ana. Miss Ana wanted me to post some before and after pictures of the cleaning, which was nice. Not only did it mean I spent a bit more time cleaning than I would've, and it feels good to be given tasks by Miss Ana!

The lock is at 85 out of 100 points now and 2.5 days left. Counting down the seconds ðŸ˜„

During a hygiene unlock I unfortunately found out that the ribbon had broken the skin and caused some damage. So I'm afraid it won't work with my current setup eitherâ€¦ But I hope I will find some way to remedy the issue.

Not been terribly horny today either, maybe because I was focusing all day. Next time, perhaps I should be cleaning in an outfit or something to make it a bit more interesting ðŸ˜Š My last IRL keyholder liked for me to cook in only an apron. That was fun.
