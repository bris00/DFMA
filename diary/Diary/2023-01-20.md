Yet another long day away from home, my train got delayed as well, so when I got home I did not have much time to complete my two tasks for the day. Miss Ana also send me a picture of her legs which was just. klKFJSfkjfgjgfkldpowpr. I need more of this in my life. Her feet are soooo good looking! ü•∞ 

When I got home, I only had about 2 hours to do the tasks. I did the ‚ÄúWatch Something‚Äù task and I watched episode 1 of The Sandman. I wrote about my thoughts here ![[s01e01]]
After this, I only had about 15 minutes left on the timer, so I posted some old embarrassing pictures to the discord server. I held back the most racy picture from the server, it's a bit too embarrassing for me ü•∫
