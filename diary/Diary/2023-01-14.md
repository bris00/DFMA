# Saturday, January 14

It's now been over 16 days since I last came. I don't know if I want to keep going or keep going through more of 2023 without orgasm 😖

Today I asked Miss Ana to be allowed to do the brainwashing task as Lilith has released a new file I wanted to listen to. Miss Ana was on board and wanted me to listen to that file! 🥳 She also called me Good Boy, which I absolutely love being called 💔 “Coincidentally” the file was about training to make the word “Good” cause feelings of pleasure, arousal, and contentment.  It was very good, I was throbbing for a long time, feeling so good. 

I also spent a few hours working on Miss Ana's share link helper. I've almost got the login flow finished, it's been a bit of mucking about with styling, which I'm no good at. And fighting some issued caused by not hosting the site on “https://chaster.app”, but I think the end result will be good.

When I woke up today, the ribbon from [[2023-01-14]] had broken. Probably because the hold had introduced a weak point. I tried again now with a load-bearing knot. So hopefully it will survive tonight and many more nights ahead. I will update the [[Tamper Proof Chastity Guide]] tomorrow if it survives.

I've got 3 days left on the lock and 20 points left, so everything should line up pretty good for next week. I don't know what, if anything, Miss Ana has planned, but we will see what happens. Regardless, I want to keep locking for Miss Ana if she'll have me since she's an amazing keyholder.
