### Intro
I am genuinely sorry for accidentally having an orgasm while I was edging for you, Miss Ana. Furthermore, I feel terrible about it, and I wish I could go back and be more careful. My body did betray me, but I do not wish to put the blame on something external. At the end of the day I am the one controlling my actions, and if my body does not do what I want then I will have to take compensating actions. I have been reflecting on a few points, and I would like to incorporate them as part of my apology to you, Miss Ana.

### What happened
I was using my vibrator to help me edge and watching some femdom porn, trying to work on a program for you, in-between edges. When I was on my 8th edge, I felt like everything was OK. But when I removed the vibrator, the pressure kept building and the restriction of the cage pushed me over the edge after about 5 seconds after removing the vibrator. It was a very messy clean-up after.

### What I did wrong
Firstly, I did not pay enough attention to my edges and the task I was given by Miss Ana, I am certain that me being distracted by other things contributed to my accident. Secondly, I already know accidents while edging is something that happens to me, and something that has happened to other simps. So I should not have gone as close to the edge as I did.

### How did this impact you
My accident has delayed the recovery of my neediness from lack of orgasms by some days, and a lack of neediness results in me being less attentive to your needs and desires, Miss Ana. I am sorry for the loss of attentiveness towards you that I have caused, Miss Ana. 

You have put time and effort into building up my horniness and neediness that through my actions have, if not become wasted, has had its effects reduced. In addition, you have now had to take time to punish me for my accident. I am very sorry for wasting your precious time, Miss Ana. 

### What I would like to do to help prevent this from happening again
1. If doing edges in the future, I should take a longer break if I feel like I have been built up too far, and spread the edges out over a longer timespan.
2. If doing edges in the future, I should pay much closer attention to the task at hand, not distracting myself with other stimuli.
3. If doing edges in the future, I should not go as close as I physically can if I have to do more than 5 edges.
4. If Miss Ana feels like I deserve it, I should practice edging more so that I can be better in the future.
