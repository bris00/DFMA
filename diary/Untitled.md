@Ricky - Dummer Slut @Bris Oh dear  Accidents happen! I want you to know first of all that you're both still good boys and I know that you didn't mean to do it and are genuinely sorry. It's okay. 

That said, I am still going to punish you. I want a handwritten apology from each of you, and 30 mins corner time, and you can both swap to your spiked cages.

### Intro
I am genuinely sorry for accidentally having an orgasm while I was edging for you, Miss Ana. Furthermore, I feel terrible about it, and I wish I could go back and be more careful. My body did betray me, but I do not wish to put the blame on something external. At the end of the day I am the one controlling my actions, and if my body does not do what I want then I will have to take compensating actions. I have been reflecting on a few points, and I would like to include them as part of my apology to you, Miss Ana.

### What happened
I was using my vibrator to help me edge and watching some femdom porn, trying to work on the app for you, in-between edges. When I was on my 8th edge, I felt like everything was OK. But when I removed the vibrator, the pressure kept building and the restriction of the cage pushed me over the edge after about 5 seconds after removing the vibrator. It was a very messy clean-up after.

### What I did wrong
Firstly, I did not pay enough attention to my edges and the task I was given by Miss Ana, I am certain that me being distracted by other things contributed to my accident. Secondly, I already know accidents while edging is something that happens to me, and something that has happened to other simps. So I should not have gone as close to the edge as I did.
