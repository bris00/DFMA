The progress has stalled if I compare it to 7 days ago. But I have lost much more than my goal over the last 4 weeks. I think the stalling is mostly because of my having been very relaxed about my diet the days I was working of the gift for Valentine's. I needed some motivation food ðŸ¤­

But now I'm ready to get back into the fasting and not cheat, at least not this week! I will commit to doing one week without any shortcuts.

The workout today was very good. I can tell that I'm in much better shape now than when I started. Still have much further to go, but I can't push myself pretty hard on the ellipsis machine now. Whereas when I started, I could not really go all out without having to stop. I can do about 2 minutes of going as hard as I can now. And before and after, I try to stay at a reasonable heart rate. I should also really buy a good heart rate monitor.
