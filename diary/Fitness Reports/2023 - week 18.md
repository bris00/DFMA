My current weight is around 81Â kg now. Got back the progress lost over the Easter, but still having problems with progressing past that. I decided to go for a Mediterranean diet the few times I do make food at home (weekends). So hopefully that will help me progress further. 

I have been doing good at working out, but not so good on my diet. Last week I drank too much coke, so I want to try not doing so at all this week. That is definitely doable, just takes a little willpower.
