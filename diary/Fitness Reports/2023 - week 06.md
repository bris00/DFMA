Still very happy with the results. Been doing the same as last week. I ate a bit much (within my time window) this weekend because I had some guests. And I think that caused a bit of a regression in my downwards trend, but I have now lost more than I gained on the weekend, so I'm still happy. Overall, lost 4Â kg since I started.
