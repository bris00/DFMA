Still very happy with the results. Been doing the same as last week. I ate a bit much (within my time window) this weekend because I had some guests. And I think that caused a bit of a regression in my downwards trend, but I have now lost more than I gained on the weekend, so I'm still happy. Overall, lost 4Â kg since I started.

I've had some problems getting my app to sync the results from weighing myself, and I did not have enough time in the mornings before work to fix it. So I lost a couple of days. But I managed to sync it again yesterday. I've had a bit too much, sweet drinks on Friday and Saturday because I felt like I needed a bit of an energy boost to work on the Valentine's Day gift for Miss Ana. So I've gone up a bit since Wednesday, but still about the same weight as a week ago. I'm sure I'll be down again by Wednesday. I also worked out today (Sunday) instead of my usual day (Saturday). Since I have been having some sore muscles in my arm since Thursday, and I think it's because I have been lifting weighs with my arms every time I've been to the gym. So I delayed until they felt better today, and I only did running and stomach muscles today. Still about 1-hour workout in total.
