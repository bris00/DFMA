I had plans for both Tuesday and Wednesday this week, so I did my workout on Monday. I've been keeping up the weight loss, even though I thought it was going to get harder by now. My new lowest is 84 kg. That's 7.5 kg reduction, and I'm very proud. At this rate, I'm going to blow through the first estimate we had. I'm attributing it mostly to only eating one big meal per day. At work during lunch, but still the workout is great for my health too!
