I had plans for both Tuesday and Wednesday this week, so I did my workout on Monday. I've been keeping up the weight loss, even though I thought it was going to get harder by now. My new lowest is 84 kg. That's 7.5 kg reduction, and I'm very proud. At this rate, I'm going to blow through the first estimate we had. I'm attributing it mostly to only eating one big meal per day. At work during lunch, but still the workout is great for my health too!

Slight regression in my weight, not sure exactly why, but I'm guessing because I had a few more meals than usual. I ate dinner with a friend on Tuesday, and I visited my mom and dad on Wednesday and had dinner at theirs. My fitness is still progressing, though, and I feel my cardio is still getting easier. I also managed 29 sit-ups vs 25 on Thursday! Over all, I feel excellent and motivated, and I've been following all of my major rules. Still been having a small amount of nuts or other “healthy” snacks in the morning. And drinking coffee without added sugar.
