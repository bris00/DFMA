With all the drinking yesterday, I had expected another somewhat disappointing result. But by some miracle I seem to have lost a lot of weight instead 😄 When progress comes is for sure a little unpredictable. But the overall trend is good, and I'm happy with that!

I set up my habitica on Monday and I added some tasks related to fitness goals there. Like a 10 minute cardio habit and “Don't consume calories outside fasting window without asking for permission from Miss Ana first”, so we will see how that works out! I did forget with the cider yesterday though 😆 so that's - HP for my avatar haha.

Back on the weekend high :D Seems like I'm bouncing a bit between 83 kg and 85 kg. Hopefully, slowly the peaks will decrease, and the troughs will as well. This weekend we also played D&D so that's always a bit of extra fruit and food. Ended up at 85.4 kg this morning.

The cardio workout is getting pretty easy, and I'm able to mostly focus on MHA without any problems. I'm not sure if I should keep doing the ellipsis machine or try something new like the rowing. 

I'm glad that my waist is not fluctuating as much as my weight, I seem to be pretty sable at about the last notch of my belt. Soon I'll have to make another hole in the belt or get another, my usual pair of pants are also a bit on the larger side now.
