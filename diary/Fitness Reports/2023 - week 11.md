With all the drinking yesterday, I had expected another somewhat disappointing result. But by some miracle I seem to have lost a lot of weight instead 😄 When progress comes is for sure a little unpredictable. But the overall trend is good, and I'm happy with that!

I set up my habitica on Monday and I added some tasks related to fitness goals there. Like a 10 minute cardio habit and “Don't consume calories outside fasting window without asking for permission from Miss Ana first”, so we will see how that works out! I did forget with the cider yesterday though 😆 so that's - HP for my avatar haha.
