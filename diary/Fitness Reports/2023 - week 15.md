Like mentioned in my last report, there wasn't much to report on during my holiday. I didn't have an opportunity really to follow my fasting regiment, and there is no guy there. But I did go on a couple of skiing trips that might be counted as somewhat of a workout. 

There's not been much progress in on my goal either for the same reasons I suspect, even though I'm finding the 82/81 kg weight a hard plateau to break through. I'm at 82.8 kg now, which is 1.8 kg heavier than my lowest recorded weight.

I had my first workout after the holiday yesterday, it was a little harder to get back into things that I thought, but I'm hoping I'll find a rhythm again and that it'll be easier again soon. I'm going to be doing 3 workouts a week like usual again from now on.

I did another workout on Friday and just finished one this morning, so feeling like I'm starting to get back in the rhythm again now. Today I only did cardio, no weights, though. Mostly because I don't have a ton of time today. But also I've been feeling like I need to take it easy on my stomach muscles. I may have gone a bit hard on them on Wednesday because on Friday it was kinda painful to do my sit ups ðŸ˜† And I still felt that same ache today. Hopefully it'll be all good for Tuesday.
