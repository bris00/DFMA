Hit a new lowest weight today, so that's fun. My body's been feeling pretty good lately, who would have thought that working out was good for you? ðŸ¤”

Got my new Fitbit yesterday, but not before my workout. So I'm looking forward to using it to keeping the correct heart rate for cardio tomorrow. And also showing off my orange colours! I have been very good with my fasting since the weekend, and will try to keep it up. Although I'm often pretty hungry after work. It's hard not to snack a little.

I have been seeing results outside the scale or gym as well, which is very fun. E.g. I have had to use my belt at two settings tighter than I used to, soon I will have to buy a new belt. Or make some new holes.
