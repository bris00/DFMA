Hit a new lowest weight today, so that's fun. My body's been feeling pretty good lately, who would have thought that working out was good for you? ðŸ¤”

Got my new Fitbit yesterday, but not before my workout. So I'm looking forward to using it to keeping the correct heart rate for cardio tomorrow. It's showing my average resting heart rate at 56 bpm, which is better than I would have thought. And also showing off my orange colours! I have been very good with my fasting since the weekend, and will try to keep it up. Although I'm often pretty hungry after work. It's hard not to snack a little.

I have been seeing results outside the scale or gym as well, which is very fun. E.g. I have had to use my belt at two settings tighter than I used to, soon I will have to buy a new belt. Or make some new holes.

Still doing superb on my weight loss! In total, down almost 6kg after these 5 weeks, so beating my goal so far ðŸ˜„ Been doing pretty good on my fasting, I have started drinking some no sugar added ice-coffee mocha. Need my caffeine kick in the mornings, but otherwise not cheated _too_
much. Working out is going great, I can just about do 20 sit-ups, which has always been hard for me. And the cardio is getting easier every time, I'm getting to the point where my legs are the issue, not my endurance. The fitbit has also been great, I think it will be a good helper for my health, seeing my heart rate and other stats is sure to be useful for measuring progress and setting future goals after I've reached my weight goal. And it's just interesting to see all the stuff available.
