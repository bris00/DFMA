New lowest weight is now 82.2 kg. I did not feel great when working out this Tuesday, not bad either but when my throat is bothering me more that my legs or being out of shape. Now that I know I'm sick, that was probably why. I'm also skipping today's workout for that reason so that I'll hopefully be recharged by Sunday.

Unfortunately the scale did cooperate this morning, so the result did not get synced :/ But I think I was at 82.6 kg.

I skipped another workout on this Sunday since I was still not feeling great, and I'm going away on Easter holiday now. But my ultimate goal is weight reduction and for that my diet is the most important I think. So I will do my best to stick with it, even though it might be a bit hard since we will be eating together. I did measure my lowest weight today though! 81 kg! So that's great! I'm really happy about it!
