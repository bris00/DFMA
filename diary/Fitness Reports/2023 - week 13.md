### 03/30
New lowest weight is now 82.2 kg. I did not feel great when working out this Tuesday, not bad either but when my throat is bothering me more that my legs or being out of shape. Now that I know I'm sick, that was probably why. I'm also skipping today's workout for that reason so that I'll hopefully be recharged by Sunday.
