We played d&d again this weekend, so I ate quite a bit of snacks on Sunday, but I tried to mostly eat fruits at least, even though it was a bit outside my eating window. I also drank a bit of alcohol when we played NHIE. But I asked Miss Ana for permission first ðŸ˜„

Something came up on Tuesday (had to help a friend) so I pushed the second workout of the week to today. Otherwise, I'm still slowly making progress, I have a new, slightly, lowest weight at 83.9Â kg now!

I forgot to make my 2nd report week 10, so I'm writing this on Monday. It seems like there is a weekly cycle to my weight loss. In the last few weeks my weekly heaviest have been on Sunday/Monday and my lightest have been Fridays, there is a fair bit of noise too though. Probably not that surprising that I eat more and move a bit less when at home, I suppose. From the lowest this week at 83.9 kg I am now 84.8 kg. Hoping I will see a better trend in the weekdays this week, as overall it has flattened out a little this month. I could probably be a bit stricter with my eating window during the weekends than I have beenâ€¦
