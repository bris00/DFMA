### 03/10
We played d&d again this weekend, so I ate quite a bit of snacks on Sunday, but I tried to mostly eat fruits at least, even though it was a bit outside my eating window. I also drank a bit of alcohol when we played NHIE. But I asked Miss Ana for permission first ðŸ˜„

Something came up on Tuesday (had to help a friend) so I pushed the second workout of the week to today. Otherwise, I'm still slowly making progress, I have a new, slightly, lowest weight at 83.9Â kg now!
