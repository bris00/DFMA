Good morning Miss Ana, I hope you're feeling better! Here's my bi-weekly fitness report. I've been following the fasting every day and only eating between 11-17, but I'm not that worried if I eat half an hour too late one day. And on the weekdays, I sometimes take a small meal of muesli and yogurt when I get home from work/training. Other than that, no sweets except I drank some coke to dinner on the weekend.

Been training every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday and I want to keep that up. You're great motivation, since I really don't want to let you down. And my work paying me for 2/3 sessions don't hurt.
 
Lost 2.7Â kg since I started on the 26th. I'm sure it will get harder as time moves along, though.

Been keeping up with the same schedule I laid out last report. Been doing good on the fasting, only cheating once I think. But I'm not aiming to be super strict, rather have something that I can be happy doing for a long time. Also been working out every other day.
