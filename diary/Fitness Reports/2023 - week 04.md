Just got home from the gym btw, so reporting my steps for today. I bought a scale and some workout clothes, I went to the gym, and I fasted (only drank water) until dinner.

The scale has been kind, but I think it's partly because of slightly different practices of when I weigh myself. As for steps I've taken I worked out on Tuesday, and I only had a bit of popcorn and nuts in addition to my main meal.
