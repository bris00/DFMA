New lowest weight today, 82.8 kg. Feels good to still be making some progress, but it still feels a bit like I'm not meeting the agreed upon goal of 0.5 kg per week. We'll see if I go any lower this week on Thursday or Friday. If not, I might have a talk with Miss Ana about some more rules to help me, perhaps.

I did not end up working out the 3rd time this weekend, first time I'm skipping a workout so I'm actually really happy with my attendance so far. I'm a little bit less happy with writing this report so late, I should've done it on Sunday, but I had so much fun, and I was blissed out by the end. And yesterday was very busy. I'm also a little less happy with my weight loss, I'm 82.4 kg today, which is my lowest and exactly 0.5Â kg lower than last week. However, this measurement was today, which is not technically part of this week's rapport. If you don't think I need any further push Miss Ana then that's up to you. But I have a suggestion for a rule if you would like to add some:

* I have to ask Miss Ana for permission to eat/drink any calories outside my eating window(11am-5pm)
