### 03/22
New lowest weight today, 82.8 kg. Feels good to still be making some progress, but it still feels a bit like I'm not meeting the agreed upon goal of 0.5 kg per week. We'll see if I go any lower this week on Thursday or Friday. If not, I might have a talk with Miss Ana about some more rules to help me, perhaps.
