### 04/7
I did a final workout on Tuesday before leaving for the holidays, where I haven't been able to do much working out. Although the two trips skiing have been working out some muscles I haven't used in a while ðŸ˜† I don't have my scale here either, and it's hard to follow the fast when we're eating together. But I'm prioritizing spending time with family, then I can get back on the horse when I get home. I'm pretty curious what my weight will be when I get home...
