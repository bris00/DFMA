Dear Miss Ana,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my devotion to you, Miss Ana. You deserve all the praise you can get! Even though I was a new face on this server, you took me in warmly and I have felt welcomed, warm, fuzzy, and at rest by your side, ever since. You may not realize it, but you have had a big positive impact on me. Thank you so much for what you've done for me, Miss Ana, I appreciate it dearly!

You make me feel safe exploring who I am, and it's been great to have someone to devote myself to who accepts me as the submissive I am. When I'm with you, I feel appreciated, like all the tasks I do for you matters and that they are noticed. You can toy with me in a way that leaves me feeling like I've lost all control, completely subservient to your every whim.

It's an odd bag of emotions, but being around you really makes me happy. I feel safe and cared for when I'm with you, and the times you have been generous enough to play and toy with me, you have made me feel so horny I cannot think straight.

I feel weak under you, like I'm powerless against your will. You make me feel vulnerable around you, and that can be scary. But it also feels perfect to be vulnerable around someone who accepts me and makes me feel listened to. 

Being around you is such an intense experience, but one that I wouldn't trade for anything. You make me feel so many things at once, and I would not have it any other way.

You are an incredibly kind person, always willing to give mercy, but you can turn up the heat when needed. Your generosity knows no bounds, and you consistently give of your time and resources to make us feel cared for. Your strictness and dominant nature, is a testament to your strength and ability to control your simps.

Furthermore, your considerate nature is something that sets you apart. I feel like you always take the time to think about the impact of your actions, and I can tell you strive to make choices that will benefit us in the end, even if we cannot see it immediately.

Finally, your patience with us is truly remarkable. Even when we make mistakes, you show that you care about us before punishing us so that we may learn.

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me, whether it's to listen to my voice recordings or reading my rambling texts about my fitness journey, My Hero Academia, or my needy questions. Your willingness to engage with me means a lot to me.

Your leadership of the dojo is inspiring, and I am grateful for the guidance and direction you provide us simps. Your ability to organize and manage tasks, especially when motivated by games, is awesome. 

Playing games with you is always a blast, and I appreciate the effort you put into making these activities even more fun and engaging for your simps. Your playful spirit and sense of humour make you a great drinking partner when we are engaging in drinking games until the late hours of the night.

Thank you for taking the time to play with me, especially the night of your birthday will always be a memory I will hold dear. It still makes me feel weak and leaky when I think back on it. Something I cannot help but do all too often.

I appreciate all the time you spend making rules for us, and all the time you spend making the choices I happily surrender to you. Your enforcement of these rules ensures that I stay on track and continue to grow and develop.

Thank you again for all that you do. Your hard work does not go unnoticed, and I am lucky to have you in my life. Please know that you are appreciated and valued. Really.

With all my heart,

Your needy simp - Bris
