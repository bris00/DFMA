Dear Miss Ana,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my devotion to you. You deserve all the praise you can get. Even though I was a new face on this server, you took me in warmly and I have felt welcomed, warm, fuzzy, and at rest by your side, ever since. Thank you so much for what you've done for me!

You make me feel safe exploring who I am, and it's been great to have someone to devote myself to who accepts me as the submissive I am. When I'm with you, I feel appreciated, like all the tasks I do for you matters and that they are noticed. You can toy with me in a way that leaves me feeling like I've lost all control, completely subservient to your every whim.

It's an odd bag of emotions, but being around you really makes me happy. I feel safe and cared for when I'm with you, and the times you have been generous enough to play and toy with me, you have made me feel so horny I cannot think straight.

I feel weak under you, like I'm powerless against your will. You make me feel vulnerable around you, and that can be scary. But it also feels perfect to be vulnerable around someone who accepts me. And you make me feel listened to. 

Being around you is such an intense experience, but one that I wouldn't trade for anything. You make me feel so many things at once, and I would not have it any other way.

You are an incredibly kind person, always willing to give mercy, but turn up the heat when needed. Your generosity knows no bounds, and you consistently give of your time and resources to make us feel cared for. Your strictness and dominant nature, is also a testament to your strength and ability to control your simps.

Furthermore, your considerate nature is something that sets you apart from others. You always take the time to think about the impact of your actions and words on those around you, and strive to make choices that will benefit the greater good. Your perfectionist tendencies can be challenging at times, but they are also a testament to your commitment to excellence.

Finally, your patience is truly remarkable. You have a calm and collected demeanor that allows you to navigate difficult situations with ease, and your ability to remain level-headed in the face of adversity is something that I truly admire.

Overall, I just wanted to say that you are an amazing person with an incredible character. Keep being you, and know that you are appreciated and valued.

Thank you Miss Ana for playing with my lock, I absolutely love it when you do that ![ðŸ’œ](https://discord.com/assets/ec10708f00b5b6767490ffe50dfe2663.svg)

1.  I started on the chaster server as a bit of a no-name, I had a some exposure in the old chastikey server but not much there either. And still you took me in at the start of this year Miss Ana, and I'm grateful for the warm welcome you've shown me. There are many things I could praise you for, the attention you give me, the way you listen when I try to communicate, the way you make me feel when you tell me what to do or I do tasks for you. But I want to tell you about something else, less sexy, now. I do experience some emotions somewhat muted, I have been better as I get older. But I rarely feel strong emotions of happiness or sadness. But in the last week I have been going to bed, tucked in before falling asleep, felling very happy. I can't explain why, but I know it is because of you Miss Ana and me feeling safe and taken care of under you! Thank you so much Miss Ana for continuing making the choices I don't want to make myself for me. And for all the time and energy you spend caring, reading about, watching and playing with all of us. ![:hug:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/870837415818985473.webp?size=100&quality=lossless) (edited)

I am very grateful to Miss Ana for spending so much time with us in VC! Especially the last weeks have been amazing, I had so much fun playing Terraria and playing drinking games with you Miss Ana. I also appreciate Dee and Camille for hosting, but this is ana-praise not #dee-praise. And I'm sure Dee is happy with that!
