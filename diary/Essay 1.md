Dear Miss Ana,

Even though I was a new face on this server, you took me in warmly and I have felt welcomed, warm, fuzzy, and at rest by your side, ever since. Thank you so much for what you've done for me!

[How you make me feel]
You make me feel safe exploring who I am, and it's been great to have someone to devote myself to who accepts me as the submissive I am.

Thank you Miss Ana for playing with my lock, I absolutely love it when you do that ![ðŸ’œ](https://discord.com/assets/ec10708f00b5b6767490ffe50dfe2663.svg)

1.  I started on the chaster server as a bit of a no-name, I had a some exposure in the old chastikey server but not much there either. And still you took me in at the start of this year Miss Ana, and I'm grateful for the warm welcome you've shown me. There are many things I could praise you for, the attention you give me, the way you listen when I try to communicate, the way you make me feel when you tell me what to do or I do tasks for you. But I want to tell you about something else, less sexy, now. I do experience some emotions somewhat muted, I have been better as I get older. But I rarely feel strong emotions of happiness or sadness. But in the last week I have been going to bed, tucked in before falling asleep, felling very happy. I can't explain why, but I know it is because of you Miss Ana and me feeling safe and taken care of under you! Thank you so much Miss Ana for continuing making the choices I don't want to make myself for me. And for all the time and energy you spend caring, reading about, watching and playing with all of us. ![:hug:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/870837415818985473.webp?size=100&quality=lossless) (edited)

I am very grateful to Miss Ana for spending so much time with us in VC! Especially the last weeks have been amazing, I had so much fun playing Terraria and playing drinking games with you Miss Ana. I also appreciate Dee and Camille for hosting, but this is ana-praise not #dee-praise. And I'm sure Dee is happy with that!
